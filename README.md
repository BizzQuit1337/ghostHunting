## Concept
It is a well known fact that spirites can effect and communicate using Electro Magnetic Fields, more commonly reffered to as EMF, this expands upon this concept, by allowing the spirites to effect the fields inside the processing chips inside your device we can facilitate more effective and dynamic communication. Now a processor chip is extreamly complicated and most spirites cannot control the effect they have on your machine, it is widley acknowledge in the IT community that apparitions can cause glitches on your device (in particular windows operating systems are especially suseptable). However by layering randomness, or having the cpu preform a random operation (generating a random number for example) causes entropy the spirites can then interact with this entropy to give intelegent answers, this principle is already working in the R.E.M Pod, by cycling rapidly through radio stations you can create a state of entropy inside the Pod, the spirites can again effect the entropy with their EMF using specific words.
