## Concept
It is a well known fact that spirites can effect and communicate using Electro Magnetic Fields, more commonly reffered to as EMF, this expands upon this concept, by allowing the spirites to effect the fields inside the processing chips inside your device we can facilitate more effective and dynamic communication. Now a processor chip is extreamly complicated and most spirites cannot control the effect they have on your machine, it is widley acknowledge in the IT community that apparitions can cause glitches on your device (in particular windows operating systems are especially suseptable). However by layering randomness, or having the cpu preform a random operation (generating a random number for example) causes entropy the spirites can then interact with this entropy to give intelegent answers, this principle is already working in the R.E.M Pod, by cycling rapidly through radio stations you can create a state of entropy inside the Pod, the spirites can again effect the entropy with their EMF using specific words.

## Modes Overview
- The first mode is called Standard, this mode reads a word list you can select on the home menue. It generates an entropic layer of randomness, from this randomness words are chosen from the wordlist, in a random order and random sentance length.
- The reverse Mode, function the same as the standard mode excpet it reverses the words. This adds an additional layer of entropy, entieties will need more energy to genereate accurate sentances
- Binary mode, Binary mode uses even more entropy than the reverse mode, but instead of reversing the words simply allows the spirite to channel all its energy into a single yes or no answer. While this uses the most entropy by far it is the easiest for the spirites to commune with as they only need to sway in a single directon.
- Tarot mode, allows the spirites to manipulate the tarot cards. the deck is shuffled on each new game and randomly played out on to the field.

## Installation
- Python version 3.11+
- need to install pygame and pyttsx3
- pip install pygame
- pip install pyttsx3
- pyttsx3 requires some methiod to play the voice, any windows device will have the default voice but on linux systems you will need to search for a package specific text to speach program, try espeak.
